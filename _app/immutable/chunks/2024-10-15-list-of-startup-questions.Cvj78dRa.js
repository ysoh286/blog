High risk, high reward. Go for the journey and the process, to be challenged, and to grow. If you cannot risk this or prefer for something more stable and more focused, then go for a mid-sized company or corporate (but even nowadays, is corporate even safe with all the layoffs lately?)</em></p> <ul><li><p>What’s the vision statement for this company?</p></li> <li><p>What are the values of the company?</p></li> <li><p>What problem are you trying to solve?</p></li> <li><p>What is your solution / product and how does that solve the problem?</p></li> <li><p>What is your target market for this product, and how will it help them?</p> <p><em>Note: the questions above could be answered via their company website - so if they do have one, you won’t need to ask these, but feel free to clarify these during interviews. A lot of the time they’ll ask you what you know about the company already so verify this is inline with what you know about the company.</em></p></li> <li><p>What are your competitors, and have any of them gained significant market share so far? If yes, how will you differentiate your product with theirs? If no, why have they not, and what makes your product going to win market share?</p></li> <li><p>When do you plan to launch MVP, and what are the core functions inside the MVP and how do they solve the problem?</p></li> <li><p>How have you shaped culture at your company and how does that align with the values established at the company?</p></li> <li><p>Currently what stage is your start-up at?</p> <p><em>Note: There are different stages at which a start up can be at before it becomes a corporate. These stages are determined based upon how they are being funded and gives you an idea of where they are at. Stages include Pre-seed > Seed > Series A > Series B > Series C - D … > Corporate. Some startups may never reach these stages or reach the next stage very quickly, others stay in a stage for a really long time, and others take a while before they get to corporate.</em></p></li> <li><p>What inspired you to come up with this idea and found this company / product?</p></li> <li><p>Who’s currently on your team?</p></li> <li><p>3 words to describe the company culture (or engineering culture)?</p></li> <li><p>What are the risks / opportunities that you currently face?</p> <p><em>Note: this is to see if the founders / execs know what problems do they have right now and how they are tackling it. If they say there are no risks or give a weak answer, then that’s a bit of a red flag.</em></p></li> <li><p>What is your endgame / end goal for this company? (is it IPO? M&A? Build a massive company and make it stand alone? Sell it to someone?)</p></li> <li><p>When is your next capital raise and what is your target goal for it?</p></li> <li><p>What is your current sales cycle and explain why is this long / short and how has that affected your runway?</p></li> <li><p>What is your current runway?</p></li> <li><p>When do you expect to break even, and what are your future plans to get there?</p></li> <li><p>How do you plan to use the money raised in XYZ round (given that you are currently hiring / spending on sales / marketing / or whatever they’ve mentioned they’re doing that’s spending $ e.t.c )?</p></li> <li><p>What is your current burn rate?</p></li> <li><p>What are your future goals for this company in 6 months, 1 year, 3 years?</p></li> <li><p>For the goal you have in 6 months, how are you making sure you meet those goals and are you currently on track to meeting them?</p></li> <li><p>When did the last person leave your company, and why did they leave?</p></li> <li><p>What’s your current churn rate for your product?</p></li> <li><p>How are you measuring that you have achieved product market fit with Product-X-Y-Z?</p></li> <li><p>How often do you give the team transparency on how things are going at the company?</p></li> <li><p>How are you funding this startup and if you have the goal of achieving 1mil ARR how do you aim to achieve that?</p> <p><em>note: 1mil ARR (annual recurring revenue) is generally a standard we see before VCs tend to invest in a start-up</em></p></li> <li><p>What is the 1 thing that makes people want or need your product and 1 thing that you could improve right now to get more customers or improve revenue?</p></li> <li><p>What is your current remote working policy, and are you flexible?</p> <p><em>Feel free to skip this if you love going to the office every day or going to the office is convenient enough for you. Flexibility is whether you can work whatever hours suit you and not a strict 9-5</em></p></li> <li><p>How is the work life balance?</p> <p><em>Note that at start-ups, they generally have driven and may require longer hours, but should still be reasonable in terms of working - just make sure to set boundaries, and be aware of what you are looking for. If you value this, do ask this - otherwise, feel free to skip this or aim for startups with at least Series B and beyond, or corporate. Another way to gauge this is to meet more team members during the interview process, and determine what their day in the life at work looks like and how their WLB looks like</em></p></li> <li><p>What are the most interesting projects you’ve worked on so far, and why?</p></li> <li><p>How has your product evolved over time as you find product market fit?</p> <p><em>This is a test to see if they have managed to pivot quickly if they’ve realised something doesn’t work, or have they gotten everything right, or are they slow to change?</em></p></li> <li><p>How have you pivoted so far in terms of achieving product market fit, and has your target customer segment changed in any way?</p></li></ul>",1);function p(e){var t=i();r(4),o(e,t)}export{p as default,l as metadata};
