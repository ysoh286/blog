Depends on use case. <ul><li>hash tables are simpler to code, and works when you don’t need ordered operations, faster for simple keys, better performance in practice on typical inputs</li> <li>balanced search trees have stronger performance guarantee, used for ordered operations if order is required and important</li></ul></li></ul> <h3>Applications of symbol tables and hash tables</h3> <ul><li>Implementation of <code>Set</code> API (holding a collection of unique keys)</li> <li>Dictionary lookups (Addresses, URL DNS lookups)</li> <li>File indexing, concordance (finding certain text occurrences in files)</li> <li>Using sparse vectors for complex matrix multiplication / dot-product calculations <ul><li>when multiplying 2 matrices, generally takes quadratic time if they are large (nested loops)</li> <li>In many applications, matrices can be large and sparse, meaning they are filled with many zeroes - in this case, this means we could reduce this calculation and the above algorithm is too expensive</li> <li>Use a symbol table representation instead via a sparse vector where we store the non-zero values and iterate across that instead</li> <li>This reduces the time down to constant time (depending on the number of rows in the matrix)</li></ul></li></ul> <h3>Thoughts</h3> <p>It’s been challenging understanding these algorithms after watching the course (and this is only part 1!), but it’s shed light on how these algorithms are important and applied to applications and daily modelling problems around us. A bit eye opening to see some Java code for the first time, and luckily it was okay to follow (it does remind me a little of Typescript).</p> <p>Still considering whether to watch part 2, but may look for another course or find more videos to watch that might help me understand these algorithms better before tackling some leetcode / algorithm problems.</p> <p>Till next time!</p> <h3>References</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1" rel="nofollow">Algorithms, Part 1</a> course on Coursera (modules 11-13)</li></ul>',1);function c(e){var i=o();n(32),t(e,i)}export{c as default,h as metadata};
