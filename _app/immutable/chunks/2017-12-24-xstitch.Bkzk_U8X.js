pattern chart (for anyone who likes cross-stitching or wants to generate their
own charts).
This idea was partly inspired from having done two cross stitches,
but having string left over and wondering what to do with it.
It would be a waste to throw it away!</p> <p>I’m still a beginner cross-stitcher, so it’s assumed that everything’s in full stitches!</p> <p>This was partly inspired by privefl’s <a href="https://github.com/privefl/pixelart" rel="nofollow">pixelart</a> app and from attending the R Forwards workshop held in Auckland early December this year by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan and Di Cook. They gave a solid introduction on the workflow of how to maintain and develop an R package within 6 hours.</p> <h2>Get started:</h2> <p>To install and get started, the package can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/ysoh286/xstitch" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> <pre class="language-r"><!></pre> <h2>What it does:</h2> <p>xstitch transforms your selected image into a cross stitch chart. It takes the
pixels of the image and maps it to those that are closest represented on the DMC
chart (to a certain colour string).</p> <p>For example, let’s take the R logo:</p> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/Rlogo.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Rlogo"> <p>To generate a cross stitch map, provide the path to your image.</p> <pre class="language-r"><!></pre> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/figure-html/rlogo-01-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Rlogo converted to cross-stich map by xstitch"> <p>This will then produce a map for you!</p> <h2>Features:</h2> <p><strong>Providing a set of string colours:</strong></p> <p>If you don’t have all the colours available, you can use the <code>select.col</code> argument
to specify which colours you are restricted to. All you have to do is provide the
DMC colour codes as a vector.</p> <p>Making the R logo restricted to a set of certain colours:</p> <pre class="language-r"><!></pre> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/figure-html/rlogo-02-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="restricted colour R-logo cross-stitch map using xstitch"> <p><strong>Specifying number of squares by height:</strong></p> <p>You can specify how many squares you would like your image to take up via
the <code>height</code> argument in <code>chart</code>. For example, if you’d like the height
to take up 75 squares instead of its default of 100, then:</p> <pre class="language-r"><!></pre> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/figure-html/rlogo-03-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="altering width and height"> Aspect ratio will be preserved. Also, a smaller number of squares creates a more 'pixelated' chart. <p><strong>Colour restriction:</strong></p> <p>If you don’t want to use 30+ colours, you can restrict the number of colours
in the chart by specifying a number through the <code>num</code> argument (also seen above).</p> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/tiger.svg" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="restrict colours using tiger example"> <pre class="language-r"><!></pre> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/figure-html/tiger-01-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="restrict colours using tiger example"> <p>The tiger’s been now restricted to 5 colours…</p> <p>Here’s another example using the R Forwards logo…</p> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/forwards.jpg" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="RForwards Logo"> <pre class="language-r"><!></pre> <img src="../assets/2017-12-24-xstitch-01_files/figure-html/forwards-01-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="X-stitch map generated from RForwards logo"> <p>which has been restricted to 10 colours.</p> <p>The caveat of using this is that it constantly changes colour every time the same
number is specified. This may be tackled in the future by restricting to a set of
selected colours by frequency.</p> <p>The <strong>xstitch</strong> package takes on a simple approach for matching colours to produce
cross-stitch charts through a single function called <code>chart</code>.
This was a fun exercise and it helped reinforce how we can develop a simple R package to solve a problem.</p> <h3>Brief developer notes</h3> <p>The steps used to create this package include:</p> <ul><li>web scraping the DMC colour chart provided here and turn it into a data frame in R</li> <li>finding packages that could manipulate images and do advanced image processing (the <code>magick</code> package)</li> <li>Use of kmeans to restrict the number of colours used (via ‘clusters’). However, it takes upon a random set of colours each time (thus not easily reproducible). A possible solution may be to select the most frequently used colours and matching these colours</li></ul> <p>A few faults:</p> <ul><li>the addition of ‘text’ across for each pixel slows everything down</li> <li>As the number of squares increases, the time taken to generate the chart increases.</li></ul> <p>It appears that using euclidean distance to calculate the closest colours may not be particularly accurate. More improvements may be needed (possible use of other classification algorithms).</p> <hr> <h3>Acknowledgements and references</h3> <ul><li>web scraping the DMC colours come from this <a href="http://www.camelia.sk/dmc_1.htm" rel="nofollow">website</a></li> <li>the <code>magick</code>,<code>png</code> packages</li> <li>Hadley Wickham’s <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">R Packages</a> book</li> <li>R logo from the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" rel="nofollow">R Foundation</a>, R Forwards logo from the <a href="https://forwards.github.io/" rel="nofollow">R Forwards website</a></li></ul>`,1);function A(h){var l=x(),o=s(b(l),10),u=a(o);t(u,()=>`<code class="language-r">devtools<span class="token operator">::</span>install_github<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'ysoh286/xstitch'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code>`),e(o);var n=s(o,12),g=a(n);t(g,()=>`<code class="language-r">library<span class="token punctuation">(</span>xstitch<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
