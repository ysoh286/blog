Every year, many companies take on a group of bright and talented individuals for a short period of time. It's amazing to see what they achieve after a few months, and each and every one of them have potential to deliver value just as much as everyone else.

The intern future-retrospective is a set of activities that were trialled with incoming interns in sprint retros when they are here. These are designed to make them set goals, be inspired and be clear about what they would like to get out of the internship.

Just as much as we are training these interns with valuable skills and getting them to contribute value, we should also care about what they are getting out of it.

## Intern futurespective

Ask the interns to write stickies / bullets on what they would like to learn and get out of their internship? What is their goal for the next 3 months? Do this on the first sprint retro they attend.

You can run these sessions with or without the mentors for the interns so that the mentors can brainstorm how they could align what the interns will be working on to their goals, aspirations and achievements.

## Intern mid-way check-in

About half-way through the internship, show your interns the stickies they wrote at the beginning - which ones are being met, which ones are not?
Is there anything you suggest we can make it better?

## Intern retrospective

On the last sprint attended by the interns at the end of their programme, provide them a board with the list they created at the beginning, and get feedback. As a team, did we provide them the support they needed to achieve the goal?
What was great about the internship, and what are some areas we can improve on? (this could be the work they did, the processes the team / organisation runs, onboarding process, e.t.c.)

These activities can be done on top of 1 on 1s. You could also do an anonymous intern programme feedback survey at the very end, but these could also be enough to get feedback to improve it for the next generation.
