I recently passed my PSM I assessment this morning! Below are some tips on how to study and for when you're sitting the assessment online.

The PSM I (Professional Scrum Master I) assessment assesses your fundamental scrum knowledge and that you know the Scrum framework outlined in the scrum guide well.

_Note: this may be subjected to change in the future - this is based on my experience when I sat the assessment in Mar 2021 with the latest Scrum guide being the Nov 2020 version._

### About the PSM I:

- 80 questions in 60 minutes
- To pass you need to score at least 85% (that means at least 68 / 80 correct - maximum you can get wrong is 12)
- Mix of multiple-choice / True or false / Select 2 / 3 best answers
- Online and open book

More about the PSM I assessment can be found [here](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-i-certification) on the Scrum.org website.

### Tips on how to study for the assessment:

- **Read the [official scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) at least twice** - the latest version to date (when this was written) is the November 2020 version. Read it and understand it.
- **Do the learning mode / real mode quizzes on [Mikhail Lapshin's website](https://mlapshin.com/index.php/scrum-quizzes/sm-learning-mode/)**. Most of the questions are currently based on the 2017 version, so there may be some terminology that's slightly off (such as 'the development team' being replaced with 'developers', and some accountabilities now belonging not just to the development team but the scrum team). Hopefully, the questions will be updated soon to align with the 2020 version (which is currently in progress). If you do get questions incorrect, find out why and look back at the Scrum guide.
- **Do the [Scrum Open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) assessment until you get 100%!** (some of these questions will come up in the real assessment)
- **Read the official scrum guide again**

- **Optional: You could also look at [ExamTopics PSM I questions](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/scrum/psm-i/)** - but be cautious of some of the answers as some questions are still related to the 2017 version
- **Optional: Take a Professional Scrum Master course run by one the Scrum.org trainers.** If you get a chance or serious about being a Scrum Master / or knowing Scrum, I would highly recommend this. It's a bit costly - a couple of thousand dollars (but if your company manages to invest in your personal development, all good) but worth it. It was an amazing course - I learnt a lot of things about Scrum and very important concepts that are tied to scrum but are not highlighted in the scrum guide. These include the squirrel burger conundrum (the tradeoff between scope, time and budget and its impact on quality), technical debt and how to handle it, context switching, the importance of having sprint and product goals, impact mapping, radical candor and how to build highly effective teams. At the end of the course, they will encourage you to take the assessment within 14 days! Only downside was it was held online - but they still did their best when there's a global pandemic going on.

And until you feel confident, you can go take the assessment!

### When doing the assessment:

- **Remember to READ the question carefully.** Do read all the choices and how many you need to pick - there are cases where you can apply a process of elimination to them (some of the choices are wrong).
- **It's an intense and open book exam** - 80 questions in 60 minutes (which means you have about 45 seconds for each question - for some questions you might spend more time on as you need to read each choice, others will take you a lot less if it's a true/false question or a question you've seen before in the Open assessment/quizzes), so you do have to know the Scrum guide and its events, accountabilities, artifacts and rules well. You can have the Scrum guide in front of you in need be just to double-check (Control-F is your best friend), but you shouldn't be spending too much time on finding answers. Remember the clock is ticking!
- **You can flag questions** that you can come back to at the end but to move on you need to select answers before moving onto the next question.
- **The assessment is only in English** - but there appears to be some Google translate plugin that can be used if English is not your first language.
- Attempt this as you would when you sit any online exam - **be in a quiet place with no distractions for the hour. Make sure you are comfortable and have a strong internet connection.**

...and once you pass - celebrate! You can start applying some of this knowledge at work or even personally (some people run scrum in their families / personally / or even for relationships) and embrace the Scrum framework!

If you're interested in going further and getting serious about scrum, there are two additional PSM assessments available to take ([PSM II](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-ii-certification) and [PSM III](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-iii-certification)). You can also think about taking courses for those or studying for those in the future - they are more applied and test knowledge on applying scrum to real-life situations and problems.

All the best, and as Ken Schwaber says: scrum on!
