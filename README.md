# blogv2

This was made for 3 reasons:

- too many security concerns appearing on the old blog which was built with Jekyll
- way to learn Svelte and SvelteKit
- to write more in 2023!

Built in Dec 2022 / Jan 2023.

This was created following this link - https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog
