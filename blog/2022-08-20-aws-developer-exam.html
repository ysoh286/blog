<article class="svelte-med8i0"><h1>Passing the AWS Developer Associate Exam after 2 years of procrastination</h1>
	<p>15 August, 2022</p>
	<div class="line-break svelte-med8i0"></div>
	
	<div class="post-content svelte-med8i0"><p>Here’s what happened - 2 years ago during lockdown, I wanted to get AWS Certified. It was something I wanted to learn - when I first learned about AWS it was hard. It was challenging. But I had my why - it’s one of the top cloud providers owning about 50% of the market and cloud software isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Knowing about cloud concepts is beneficial and useful as an engineer. Even though I currently don’t use it in my daily work (I’m a front-end engineer usually playing around, building and maintaining UI/UX), it still gives me a bit of an edge.</p>
<p>Except even with all this motivation, I procrastinated. I kept telling myself I wasn’t ready. I didn’t want to study. The old “I’ll study later” excuse.</p>
<p>That dragged on for 2 years. 2 years! Can you believe it?!</p>
<p>Fast forward to June 2022. I got off my arse and paid for my exam. Booked it 2 months for August 2022. I set myself a goal that I would study for the next 2 months (on and off after work in the evening and during the weekends). I took 3 days of leave just to cram and sit the exam.</p>
<p>Thank goodness I passed and it lasts for 3 years.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<ul><li>Stephane Maarek’s course on Udemy is really good. His content is understandable and clear. If you’re a beginner or you’ve never touched AWS before - go through his course a couple of times to familiarise yourself with the concepts. Get a free tier account and do a hands-on (or just get an account just follow the steps but don’t follow through to the end if it costs money). Note that his content covers about 70-80% of the material. Follow his tips on the exam too - they’re pretty accurate.</li>
<li>Do some practice questions - Jon Bonso’s from TutorialsDojo practice questions set quote from a reviewer “makes your brain squirm” really does. But for good reason - you’ll learn a bit from doing these questions and the format is similar to that to the real exam. I found them harder than the actual exam, but nevertheless tests your knowledge. Do these until you are confident with your score.</li>
<li>ExamTopics questions - these are also great for practice too.</li>
<li>AWS Documentation - these are best for covering ground on missing content or to fully understand a concept you may be unfamiliar or weak on. They’re incredibly informative, clear and up to date.</li>
<li>Topics they like to test (as of 2022): Serverless (DynamoDB, Lambda, SAM, API Gateway), S3, Cognito (authentication / authorization), Elasticache, Elastic Beanstalk deployments, IAM, Security (KMS / Encryption)</li></ul>
<p>For the exam:</p>
<ul><li>Make sure you rest on the day of the exam! Don’t think too much.</li>
<li>Remember to bring your ID (passport will do)</li>
<li>You can choose to do it at a test center or an online proctored exam - I’d prefer test centers as it saves you the hassle of having to install software, the responsibility is partly on you to get your gear correct and running for the duration of the exam, also need a webcam on at all times and you can’t leave your seat or go to the toilet. At a test center you might be able to and you don’t need to take responsibility for the set up.</li>
<li>Most test centers should provide you some materials you can write on - you should take these in case if you need to draw diagrams for clarity and do calculations (such as calculating RCU / WCU units on DynamoDB)</li>
<li>Breathe and keep track of time - flag any questions during the exam to come back to review to if you are spending too much time on it</li></ul>
<p>Note to self for the next exam / certification: book the exam - set a goal, and just book it. Otherwise you’re never gonna get it done.</p>
<p>And there you have it! Maybe I’ll go for the solutions architect one next time… (:</p></div>
