<article class="svelte-med8i0"><h1>A review on mentoring interns</h1>
	<p>2 March, 2023</p>
	<div class="line-break svelte-med8i0"></div>
	
	<div class="post-content svelte-med8i0"><p>Mentoring interns has been a part of my time as a software engineer and a way of giving back to the community.</p>
<p>It’s not easy - it takes time and dedication, but it does get easier with practice.
The worst experience you can give an intern is one that doesn’t leave them fufilled or provides them a learning experience.</p>
<p>Things learned:</p>
<h3>If you are mentoring an intern, make sure they have something to do before they start and you can help them out</h3>
<p>The worst situation to put your intern in is to get them to twiddle their thumbs and scramble for something to do. It just screams bad planning from the organisation. Also, it makes it so much easier if the project they get assigned to is within your domain and something you know about.
If you are being assigned an intern, spend some time figuring out what project they’re assigned to. If it’s someone elses’ project, you may need to tread caution.</p>
<h3>Be prepared to be reverse mentored at the same time</h3>
<p>As an engineer, practice humility. For the past interns I’ve mentored, all of them gave me advice or helped me learned new things on the way. They also challenged the way I would do things which put things into perspective.</p>
<h3>The best interns are the ones who take initiative</h3>
<p>My usual style of mentoring interns is to throw them in the deep end. It’s weird, but it makes them learn and go explore. Software engineering is all about learning, making mistakes and figuring out the best solutions to the problem. Make sure you go through any guidelines or standards that are to be followed before doing this. If an intern needs direction, steer them in the right path, but don’t spoon feed all the answers.</p>
<h3>Set some time aside for your intern to ask questions</h3>
<p>Be there for them! This is one I see most often neglected by mentors who claim they are busy. If you are busy, set a time specifically for the intern and tell them that this is the time for them. If you really are so busy that you don’t have time for them then you should probably tell your manager about reconsidering to take on an intern. Make it informal - remember they are there to learn, and they’re new to all this. Think back to when you were a junior - what would you have wished for from a mentor? Be that.</p>
<h3>Give them feedback on how they’re doing and check in with them from time to time</h3>
<p>Sometimes you might set a time for them and once they’re up and running they’re making waves. But do check in with them on their progress. A simple ‘How are you doing?’ is enough. A simple “all good” is all you need to know to back off. If you see them struggling or panicking, ask them. Remember you’re their first point of contact if they need help. If it’s outside of the project or something you can’t control, direct them to others who can help them.</p>
<h3>Ask for feedback for how they feel about you being a mentor</h3>
<p>This could be done as a separate piece with your manager (or through HR). Most interns might not be so upfront about this so it’s better to get someone else to ask this to get feedback. An anonymous survey could also work. This would help you improve on the next intern you get, along with any other organisational processes and planning that needs to be looked at before starting the next internship programme.</p>
<h3>Don’t berate yourself.</h3>
<p>This was a tough one I learned when I mentored an intern for the first time - I felt I wasn’t good enough. Classic imposter syndrome.
At the end of the internship, the intern was honest and candid about my actions, and he said that he learned a lot despite me constantly saying that he didn’t need any help. At the time I felt embarrassed, but it made me reflect on my mistakes and make note of what I could do better and how I should act around interns and other developers. I appreciated that intern’s feedback (although it was public in front of the whole company) and it made me become a better mentor.</p>
<h3>Treat the opportunity as a chance to showcase your leadership and management skills</h3>
<p>This is usually a stepping stone into showing off some leadership and management skills which could be accounted for in your next promotion. Other times, it’s to prepare you to mentor more people in the future as you go higher up on the career ladder. Senior engineers tend to spend some time mentoring and teaching junior engineers, so take it as an opportunity to figure out whether it’s for you. You might find you enjoy doing mentoring, or not so much.</p>
<p>Be the mentor you wished you had when you started out as a junior, and take a look at which mentors you’ve looked up to in your past career. What did they do that you liked and helped you the most to get to where you are today?</p></div>
