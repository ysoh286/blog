<article class="svelte-med8i0"><h1>Thoughts on being a scrum master for a year</h1>
	<p>20 April, 2022</p>
	<div class="line-break svelte-med8i0"></div>
	
	<div class="post-content svelte-med8i0"><p>These are my reflections after being a scrum master for a year.</p>
<p>Thoughts &amp; personal opinions: (note, all these are my own)</p>
<h2>A great career opportunity</h2>
<p>If you ever get the chance to or are interested in servant leadership and being transformative and building high performance teams that deliver value, then this role is for you. It was fun having a bit of power but definitely eye-opening on what a scrum master does and why it’s so important. The events are what make the team have some structure to uncertainty. Sometimes you see teams fall apart after having no-one to facilitate meetings as needed. A team can be self-organising and managed, but at times you still need someone to make sure they’re still grooving, taking feedback and helping them along the way.
Whoever’s been telling you that scrum masters don’t do anything, it either means the way they run things is not effective, or they’re not being heard and the advice they’re giving is not being considered. And running meetings is a skill! Scrum masters are hot in demand anywhere as many companies begin to transition to agile environments due to changing markets, increased volatility and risk, and won’t be going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<h2>You’ll build confidence in running / facilitating meetings</h2>
<p>I used to be a very shy person - I still am when I meet people (I sometimes might come off as rude - most of the time it’s more like I don’t know what to say so I keep quiet, or I’m scared that I’ll say the wrong thing). I hate public speaking, and I hate going into meetings. Now I don’t fear it as much. Running stand-up everyday and facilitating meetings improved my confidence.</p>
<h2>You might get tired, so remember to take breaks</h2>
<p>Running sprints back to back is tiring - the minute 1 sprint ends, another begins and the 1 thing I regret most is not taking a break from the role. It can also get into a routine, which has its benefits and drawbacks too. Being a scrum master involves being empathetic and understanding of others in your team, along with fighting for what feels right for the team when needed. Weirdly enough there’s actually a feeling of overdoing it, leading to burnout. Sometimes you forget about yourself and you care most about others beyond yourself. So remember to take some time off to focus on yourself.</p>
<h2>You can only thrive as much when the whole organisation (including executives and management) are on board with you and are willing to embrace change</h2>
<p>Some companies say they do scrum, but really they do all the sprint meetings but their work is still being handled as with a traditional project management ‘waterfall’ approach, and their culture isn’t really agile. In order for agile / scrum to work, you need everyone on board behind you. Whether it’s to give you an opportunity to prove or trial something in sprint, they need to trust you in order to drive change and to improve processes. If management’s not on board, convince them or show them why. It’s a tough position because chances are you’ll be in a position where management doesn’t want to change (as they have the experience to say ‘we’re doing it this way, we’ve been doing it like this for the past x years, why should we change - don’t rock the boat’).
It’s a tough sell for long term changes to surface - especially when management want results now when change takes effect and can only be seen a few months or years down the line.
If it doesn’t work, you’ll just be stuck in doing the same processes again and again.</p>
<h2>It feels like context switching if you are doing it with another role</h2>
<p>Depending on what your other role is (generally a developer or engineer), in my opinion I found it tough to balance both roles as they require different skills.
I strongly believe a scrum master is a full time job on its own. I didn’t really have time to explore, research or go above and beyond the team and look at organisation and other aspects that could be improved with agile. Although many companies rotate or get a person in the development team to do this, it feels more like an anti-pattern. Some people are naturally good at it, others need to spend time on it to get better or just hate it in general.</p>
<h2>Being a scrum master is like being behind the scenes (or the supporting character)</h2>
<p>This could be a good / bad that may vary from personal preference. It’s a job that you do a lot behind the scenes, or where people assume all you do is run meetings (and possibly complain why they get paid so much for doing nothing - though if you are feeling this way, it either means scrum isn’t being effective or implemented properly, or it’s not suitable for the work you’re doing), but the reality is that you will make sacrifices in best efforts to support your team and empower them, along with advocating for changes. Whether it’s collecting feedback and conveying it to management, or fighting over priorities with the product owner.</p>
<h2>Change may not be visible, and takes time to appear</h2>
<p>If you’re someone who’s used to looking at results immediately or not very patient, then this might be frustrating. When people are winning and thriving in your team, chances are you’re doing a good job even though you might not feel it. Some changes may take months or even years to surface before they gain agility, so at times you’ll need to exercise patience and sometimes every 2 sprints it might not feel like anything’s moving.</p>
<h2>The more you try control a team, the more likely it might backfire on you</h2>
<p>This depends on the team itself but this was a tough lesson I had to learn when I first started. There was a time I questioned them why they didn’t write their JIRA stories, and it came off the wrong way like scolding a bunch of naughty children who’d forgotten to do their homework. I had tried to justify why it was important to write them and to use the template provided, but in the end it fell on deaf ears. Instead, I tried a different approach and made them pair up and think about what’s the most difficult thing about writing tasks on JIRA - and it turned out they would not write them because alot of them felt they were a waste of time as things were constantly changed. Instead, we changed it so that the format was simpler and easier to fill out. Some team members began to write on it, which was a better improvement than last. It hit me hard that a scrum master’s there to teach, coach, but most importantly to let the team figure out their problems and come up with their own solutions.</p>
<h2>Find a mentor / agile coach (especially when you’re starting out)</h2>
<p>This one I really wished I found one or reached out to one - it was really hard to get ideas (as a new scrum master) and there’s only so much on Google until you run out of all the variations and combinations. If you get the opportunity to learn from someone, take it - they’ll guide you and you’ll learn and be able to discuss different situations and tackle common problems with your team.</p>
<p>A year has passed. Although I may be good at something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s sustainable or to my liking. For now, I’ll take a break from the scrum master role, get some more experience, see what it’s like out there in other environments and organisations to re-evaluate and decide whether I’d still aim for it as a career path. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity and don’t regret taking it.</p>
<p>It’s been eye-opening, challenging and rewarding, but as always - everything comes with a price.</p></div>
