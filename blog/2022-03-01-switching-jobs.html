It usually comes down to researching and googling “should I quit my job”, or asking someone who’s done it before (such as your manager - if you have a good one or a more experienced colleague).</p> <p>It’s a tough decision to switch jobs but I finally made the leap despite being in lockdown a few months ago.</p> <p>A few ways to check it out or ask yourself:</p> <ul><li>Do you feel happy at work and with the work you’re delivering?</li> <li>Is your work giving you a sense of purpose? If you’ve got a vision or something you stick to, does your work still align with it?</li> <li>Have you gotten bored / are you still learning / can you see yourself grow both personally and career-wise?</li> <li>Based on how long you’ve been there, can you see if staying will take you to where you want to be?</li> <li>Have you been complaining to your friends about work more than usual?</li> <li>Do you feel too comfortable at work, and in need of a new challenge?</li> <li>Are you stressed out or feeling undervalued at work or just had enough of the toxic culture?</li> <li>Do you find things that didn’t bother you at all before now seem to get on your nerves?</li> <li>What’s the job market like?</li></ul> <p>It’s hard to leave a company - you could be working with amazing people and a collaborative team, and you’d be tempted to stay comfortable in your bubble. But sometimes, if you can’t see yourself grow or get to where you want to be or are feeling overwhelmed and stressed all the time, then maybe it’s time to go.</p> <h2>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try taking a break</h2> <p>If you’ve been working non-stop for a while, feel overwhelmed and have some annual leave accumulated then maybe you need a break. Take some time off to rest and not think about work. It’s hard - but if you come back feeling refreshed in your job and still think it’s great, then maybe you don’t need to switch.
However, if you do come back and realise it’s not giving you the same sparks when you first started the job (or excites you in any way, or you still dread going to work as much as you did before you rested), then maybe it’s time to move on.</p> <h2>But what if you’re trying to find a good time to leave?</h2> <p>To be honest, there is never a good time to leave. The reality is that whether you’re leaving mid-way through a delivery deadline or not, that’s simply how life is. The question is why do you want to leave and whether you can find it at your current company. If not, it’s time to go. You don’t owe anything to the company. You could stall it for a while, but at some point there will be something to push you.</p> <h2>When you make your decision, start preparing for the job search</h2> <p>If you’ve concluded that you’re ready to leave, start the job search and do this after office hours. Update and tweak your CV, get another pair of eyes over it, and prepare to do some research on some of the companies you apply to to write that cover letter. Target and tailor your CV and cover letter to match the skills and keywords required on the job description. For engineering positions, chances are you’ll probably need to brush up on some technical interviewing (which may mean revisiting some algorithms and theory depending on which company you’re applying for). But of course, every company will ask you the usual questions:</p> <ul><li>Who you are, introduce yourself and how you are a good fit for this position / job?</li> <li>Why do you want to work at (insert company here)?</li> <li>What do you know about our company?</li> <li>Why are you leaving your current job / company?</li> <li>Where you see yourself in 3-5 years?</li></ul> <p>And always prepare some questions to ask too - remember treat this as a conversation - it’s your chance to find out more about them as much as it is about them finding out about you (they’re also looking for culture fit and skills to do the job, while you’ll be considering learning opportunities, meeting your next manager / mentor / boss, the company culture and environment). Remember you’ll be spending 8 hours a day (if not more) for 5 days a week so take your time to evaluate!</p> <h2>See every interview experience as a learning experience and redirection (if it results in rejection)</h2> <p>Sometimes you’ll need to accept the fact that you may get lots of rejections and it sucks. Treat every interview as a learning experience - you can always reflect on each stage and see what went well and didn’t. Remember it’s a two way street - sometimes timing isn’t right, other times it might be the company already has someone in mind, or you might find that there’s a mis-match in culture fit or a red flag. And sometimes, it may have worked out for the better. Eventually you will find something that matches. There’s only so much you can get out of interviews and technical tests - do the best you can, and those who are willing to take an opportunity on you will do in due time.</p> <h2>Get in contact with your references</h2> <p>If you’re nearly being offered something, you’re likely to be asked for references. If you haven’t reached out or haven’t talked to them in a while, reach out politely and give them the choice of whether they would like to become your reference (if they feel uncomfortable, move on to the next). The best people would be any managers or former colleagues you’ve worked with who are willing to support your career, know how you work and what you can achieve.
You should have 2-3 referees available when you reach that stage. Ask the recruiter what sort of questions they would like to ask or information they’d like to know so that you can pass this information to your referees. Make sure your referees are comfortable with answering these questions so when the recruiters call, they would have some idea of what’s coming their way.</p> <h2>Tread carefully if you are using it as a bargaining chip</h2> <p>If you still like your company, but think you deserve more, you may be tempted to use it to get a counter offer. But be wary - it could completely backfire on you. If you are ready to leave and you have a weak heart (or are easily persuaded like I am), might be better off to stay away from this and get your written offer and sign up to the new job before tendering your resignation.</p> <h2>Always call someone about your resignation before formally putting it into writing</h2> <p>Resignations are hard, but it’s better to have a chat with someone in person (whether it’s your manager or someone higher up). You don’t need to say why you’re leaving (unless they explicitly ask, but even if they do keep it neutral), and ask further on procedures (if any) on how to give notice, and make sure it’s in writing.</p> <h2>Don’t badmouth or burn bridges with your current company, leave on a positive note and give good notice</h2> <p>They say that it’s a small world, so it may be likely you do will work with someone again (or see them interviewing for a position). So don’t ever badmouth the company (unless you’re leaving quickly because you find out they lied to you at the interviews). Be kind to everyone - you never know they might be your next boss on landing your next role.</p> <h2>Try not to beat yourself up with self doubt, trust your gut</h2> <p>I’m still fighting with this and the fear of the unknown - sometimes you just need to take a leap of faith. It’s human nature to hate change and discomfort, but ironically that’s what makes us grow as human beings.
If it turns out really bad or not what you expected, keep looking again (it might be tough, but do what’s best for you). Most companies have a probation period, so if you manage to find another job offer in time, you might be able to start soon. And if it turns out great and you’re learning heaps - awesome!
Don’t feel regret when you’ve handed in your resignation even when it feels like things have started to change - you’ve thought it through before you decided to look. Remember that you’re easily replaceable to a company, but your mental health, happiness and wellbeing isn’t.</p> <h2>Remember to keep in contact with old colleagues and expand your network</h2> <p>You never know who’ll be on the other side interviewing you - it could be a former colleague, or even someone you’ve met before whom you’ve interviewed before. Be kind and don’t be an arse.</p> <p>Switching jobs is a tough decision (especially when you’re working at least 8 hours a day for 5 days a week), and there is risk to it - but sometimes it pays off. Find your worth, your growth and get closer to achieving your career goals and having the career you want in life.</p><!----></div></article><!----><!----></main> <footer class="svelte-1stbkrt"><nav class="svelte-1stbkrt"><ul><a href="..">Home</a></ul></nav> <p class="svelte-1stbkrt">Built with SvelteKit | 2023.</p></footer><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
