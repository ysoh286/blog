(Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020).</p></blockquote> <p>There’s a whole <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html" rel="nofollow">Scrum guide</a> to teach you what scrum is and its artifacts - and scrum masters try to adhere to it by facilitating key scrum meetings, identifying ways to improve
efficiency and productivity of the scrum team, while informing the organisation of what behaviours align with scrum and hurt the team.</p> <p>It’s hard, it’s crazy, it’s challenging (who likes changing peoples’ habits and also realising that you might be a control freak? And of course,
as much as you hate cutting people off - you sometimes have to stop them from rambling,
or roast them for not moving a JIRA ticket because your burndown chart will look like the cliffs of doom).</p> <p>Below are 10 things I’ve learnt from being a Scrum Master so far.</p> <h3>Scrum theory is straightforward on paper, but hard to implement</h3> <p>This is true. It’s hard to change peoples’ habits and adapt to the unknown.</p> <h3>Team building is important as it increases and encourages collaboration</h3> <p>Do some team-building exercises. This creates team culture and the idea of being open. Transparency is one of the key pillars of scrum. When
everyone knows each other and their quirks, their more likely to share their ideas and problems, collaborate and solve together as a team.</p> <h3>Transparency is key to enforce trust between all parts of the team</h3> <p>The more transparent everyone is about their work, the easier it is to
tackle and solve problems together. Being a scrum master has made me realise
how much teamwork is involved. With scrum, you see the entire team as one and it’s powerful
and incredibly satisfying when you see an increment delivered.</p> <h3>Encourage people to speak up about blockers during the stand-up</h3> <p>Sometimes some people need a bit of a push when it comes to sharing their problems.
Asking “Who do you need help from?” is enough to spark them in the right direction. If they don’t know, ask them to share their problem or “what is blocking you from moving forward?“.
One of the main responsibilities of the scrum master is to point people in the right direction and remove blockers for the team where possible. Most of the time I can’t do this myself, but about 90% of the time someone else in the team would know!</p> <h3>Never run stand-up sitting down - it’s called a stand-up for a reason</h3> <p>When people sit down there’s a strong likelihood for people to ramble on or have a full-on discussion about tasks. It’s so weird - when we ran ‘sit-down’ standups, it would take 30-40 mins, sometimes even 50 minutes just to walk the board. That’s more than twice as long as a normal stand up would take! 15 minutes is enough and get people on their feet for this.</p> <h3>Don’t waste time waiting for clients / never pull in tasks that are “not ready” into a sprint</h3> <p>Sometimes you may have team members who end up being blocked on a task because it’s waiting for a client. You’re better off directing that team member to more important work that can be done rather than waiting. Generally, you might also be able to capture this at refinement sessions or during planning where it is good to encourage your team members to raise blockers or anything that will stop them from progressing further on any of the tasks they are assigned to. This could include tasks that rely on external data sources, waiting for data from clients, or a business decision, or not having enough clarity on a task. This will make members realise “hey, this is not ready” to be worked on in the sprint.</p> <h3>Give your team the power to define their tasks and the creative freedom on how to tackle problems</h3> <p>Remember your team members are the experts in their respective fields. As much as there may be tasks that are mandatory or need to meet from a delivery perspective, remember to give them prompts rather than tasks so they can still have the creative freedom and explore solutions. All it needs to meet is the goal!</p> <h3>Communication is king</h3> <p>The main purpose of the daily standups is to communicate as a team. Talk with your team members, talk with your product owner, talk with management. It’s the only way to all get on the same page so that it minimises the last minute “Hang on that’s not what we want” moment that we all dread.</p> <h3>Retrospectives are important - do NOT skip them</h3> <p>I wonder why we never had retros before - but it’s becoming increasingly important as it allows the team to reflect but also bring in ideas/solutions to problems they face during the sprint. You can always use the time to also get the team to think forward into the future and raise any risks/concerns they see happening, and give them a head start on thinking about solutions.</p> <h3>Show, don’t tell</h3> <p>This is something I’m still struggling with - but it’s about showing the team and getting the team to realise when something’s wrong rather than telling them. There have been a lot of times I’ve tried telling the team about something, and it sort of just goes in one ear out the other or they don’t see the issue (or the point).
If this happens, try to find ways to make the team discover it themselves. This is something I hope to improve on (and attempt to resist the urge to speak for them / fill the silence). When you have the team realising the issue and the why, they’re more likely to take action and change.</p> <p>And that sums up most of the 4-5 months I’ve been doing scrum for. I’m incredibly thankful to the team that I’m a part of and hope more success keeps coming our way. There’s still so much more to learn and get better at.</p> <p>Till next time!</p> <hr> <h3>Acknowledgements and references</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html" rel="nofollow">The Scrum Guide 2020</a> by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the original pioneers of Scrum</li></ul><!----></div></article><!----><!----></main> <footer class="svelte-1stbkrt"><nav class="svelte-1stbkrt"><ul><a href="/">Home</a></ul></nav> <p class="svelte-1stbkrt">Built with SvelteKit | 2023.</p></footer><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
